  <h1>Problem Set 3</h1>
  <pre>
    The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

    What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
  </pre>

  <p>
    A factor that is a prime number. In other words: any of the prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the original number.
    <br><br>Example: The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5 (because 3Ã—5=15, and 3 and 5 are prime numbers).
  </p>


  <p>
    Initially, let (A) be the number you are interested in - in this case, it is 600851475143. Then let (B) be 2. Have a conditional that checks if (A) is divisible by (B). If it is divisible, divide (A) by (B), reset (B) to 2, and go back to checking if (A) is divisible by (B). Else, if (A) is not divisible by (B), increment (B) by +1 and then check if (A) is divisible by (B). Run the loop until (A) is 1. The (3) you return will be the largest prime divisor of 600851475143.

    Let (A) = 105. (B) = 2 (we always start with 2), and we don't have a value for (C) yet.

Is (A) divisible by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 3. Is Is (A) divisible by (B)? Yes. (105/3 = 35). The largest divisor found so far is 3. Let (C) = 3. Update (A) = 35. Reset (B) = 2.

Now, is (A) divisible by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 3. Is (A) divisible by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 4. Is (A) divisible by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 5. Is (A) divisible by (B)? Yes. (35/5 = 7). The largest divisor we found previously is stored in (C). (C) is currently 3. 5 is larger than 3, so we update (C) = 5. We update (A)=7. We reset (B)=2.

Then we repeat the process for (A), but we will just keep incrementing (B) until (B)=(A), because 7 is prime and has no divisors other than itself and 1. (We could already stop when (B)>((A)/2), as you cannot have integer divisors greater than half of a number - the smallest possible divisor (other than 1) of any number is 2!)
